# Tools That I Use for Evals

## Current Tools:

- Makefile
	> This runs Norminette with its flag (-R CheckForbiddenSourceHeader) when you run make on the file that you specify, you can enter nothing and it just runs it on all files in the same location as the Makefile.

To run:

---

Run make, then enter the specified directory with the prompt.
e.g. >make; outputs: "Specify the file on which to run Norm:" ./Hello/World/!.c runs Norm on the file !.c.

### Feel free to use these.
